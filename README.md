### Meta grid

A flexbox based responsive grid.


#### Why flexbox?

First there were tables then divs now flexible boxes.
The shift from divs to flex is the same as it was from tables from divs.

With flexbox we can forget <code>position: relative</code> and <code>float:left</code> instead we have grid elements (boxes) which can be easily sized and positioned wherever we want. And they can be easily interchanged for mobile support.
